# Build Instructions

```bash
# Create and enter build directory
mkdir build
cd build

# Generate build files
cmake ..

# Generate executables
make
```

Produces two executables: `ubuntufetch`, the CLI application, and `tests`, the unit tests.

# Documentation

See the [wiki section](https://github.com/jel-PDX/UbuntuFetch/wiki) of the Github repository for architecture (technologies, implementation) and QA documentation (unit, acceptance, cross-platform testing). Both are living documents that I will update throughout the period of completing this assignment.

The source code of the unit tests, in-line comments across all source code, and the commit history of this repository serve as additional documentation.
